This is a demo of a simple external store implemented using React's `useSyncExternalStore`. The library code is at `lib/molecule.ts`. Two stores are given in the `store` folder to demonstrate how to use the library. The `app` folder contain a Next.js app that demonstrates a reactive UI powered by the external store.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:
